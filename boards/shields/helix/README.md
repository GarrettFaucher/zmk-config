#### Note to user:

- If desired, RGB underglow must be manually enabled before building and flashing. Check 'helix.conf' to do so.
- Peripheral RGB function is impaired until full support is implemented in the master branch.
- OLED displays are not currently included in this shield. This will be updated after OLED support is live.
- 'KANA' and 'EISUU' input is currently utilized under the 'LANG1' and 'LANG2' keycodes respectively.
